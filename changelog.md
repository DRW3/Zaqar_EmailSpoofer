#[Unreleased] - Upcoming Changes, Current Projects, and 'wish list' items
-We could totally use a cool logo for Zaqar. The app is sleep and simple, so something modern with a flat design would be cool. I am going to open that one up to the community for that one.
-I have played around with JS frameworks like taggle.js and Tagger.js to make a 'pool' of "to emails" but it didn't really work super well. Other ways to show a visual pool of emails would be cool
-The ability to choose Cc and Bcc might also be cool--it would be simple, just not sure how to adjust the UI
